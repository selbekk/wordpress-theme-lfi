# Wordpress theme: LFI

A Wordpress theme created for Lillestr√∏m Fysikalske Institutt.

## Development

First, install dependencies with `npm install`.

Run `npm run watch` to start a watch task.

Run `npm run build` to create a distribution.

Copy the `theme/` folder to your Wordpress installation (I've set up my
installation as a [Vagrant image](http://vccw.cc/)), and you're ready to go.
